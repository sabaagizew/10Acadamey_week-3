# Pharmaceuticals sales Price Prediction

The finance team of Rossmann wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks 
ahead of time. Managers in individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal 
judgement to forecast sales. The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school 
and state holidays, seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various 
stores. The task is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in 
the finance team.

Data exploration

Date Exploration is demonstrated notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb

some insights about the data are described

Daily, yearly, monthly sale trends are analysed

Sesionality of sales are analyzed

Multi variable sales prediction 

A machine learning approach to implement multi variable sales prediction implemented.

Date preprocessing from regression models.

A random forest model and linear regression model is implmented using pythons sklearn pipeline to create our model.

Feature importance calculation

The resulting 2 models are serilzed and stored in Models folder
